# Git the Game

This repository contains **Git the Game** -- a card game mimicking Git (and GitHub), and it is written and designed in LaTeX using TikZ.

The latest version is here: [gitgame.pdf](https://github.com/arkonia/GitGame/blob/main/gitgame_de.pdf) (German version)

Pending improvements are:
- translation into English
- *branching* as an expert variant
